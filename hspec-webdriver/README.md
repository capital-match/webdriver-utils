This package integrates [hspec](http://hspec.github.io) with
[hs-webdriver](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/webdriver), allowing you to write webdriver tests
using hspec.  The `webdriver-angular` package has some example tests
[Specs.hs](https://bitbucket.org/wuzzeb/hs-webdriver-angular/src/tip/webdriver-angular/test/Specs.hs/?at=default).
(Even though the test page uses AngularJs, the use of the `hspec-webdriver` package is a good
example.)
