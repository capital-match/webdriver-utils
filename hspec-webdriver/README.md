This package integrates [hspec](http://hspec.github.io) with
[hs-webdriver](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/webdriver), allowing you to write webdriver tests
using hspec.  This package contains no code testing the `hspec-webdriver` package itself.  The
`webdriver-angular` package contains some test code which test both the Angular webdriver commands
in `webdriver-angular` and some tests of functions in `hspec-webdriver`.
